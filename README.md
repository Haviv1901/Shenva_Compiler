# Welcome to Shenva!

shenva is a compiled low level programming language with a 
high level feeling to it. It was created as a gateway language 
for python users to learn C, and it tries to combine the two languages into 
an easy to read syntax. The pourpuse of the language is to help high level 
programmers to get used to the syntax of C and C++, and to help them have a better
understanding of assembly, the stack, and pointers.

Our compiler can compile one file of shenva code into an exe. It supports variables,
conditions, loops functions, and pointers. Its also an open source project, so feel 
free to add features like includes and memory allocation.

this project was made as a final project for "Magshimim" program, Israel's offical cyber education program.
